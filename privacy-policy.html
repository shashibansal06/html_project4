                    <p>At Emoodi, we take the privacy of our customers (‘Customer’, ‘you’ or ‘your’) very seriously.  This Privacy Policy is designed to tell you about our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information that Emoodi (‘us’, or ‘we’) or its third-party service providers collect through the mobile application (‘Emoodi’ or ‘Application’).  Data collected through your use of the Application is governed by this Privacy Policy.  Please be sure to read this entire Privacy Policy before using the Application.</p>
                   <p>By accessing or using Emoodi, you consent to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.  We may modify or update this Privacy Policy at any time effective upon its posting to the Application.  Your continued use of this Application constitutes your acceptance of this Privacy Policy and any modifications or updates thereto.</p>
                   <h2>Personal Information:</h2>
                   <p>Your use of Emoodi may cause certain information, including information you may consider personal to you (‘Personal Information’), to be stored locally on your mobile phone, tablet, media player, or personal computer (‘Device’).  This data includes specific details of your life and moods.  We will treat your Personal Information and data as confidential.  We will not share your Personal Information or data with third parties, such as third party service providers and/or advertisers. </p>
                   <h2>Information Sharing</h2>
                   <p>Emoodi allows you to share certain information with social networks including Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.  Emoodi will never automatically share your information to social networks and/or third parties without your consent.</p>
                   <p>Emoodi is in no way responsible for the protection of any information that you choose to share with social networks.  You and such social networks are solely responsible for the protection of such information.  Please review any applicable policies and procedures of such social networks before sharing your information therein.</p>
                   <p>Emoodi may automatically collect anonymous information regarding your interaction with, and use of, Emoodi.  Information we may collect includes, but is not limited to, device identifier and hardware information, system type, and other information about your interactions with the Application.

                   <h2>Security</h2>
                   <p>We take reasonable steps to protect information about you that is in our possession and control, such as your Personal Information and data, from loss, misuse, and unauthorised access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.  Unfortunately, no internet transmission is ever completely secure or error-free.  Email sent between you and us may not be secure, due, for instance, to the security practices that you, your email carrier, and/or Internet provider employ.  You should therefore take special care in deciding what information you send to us via email.  Please keep this in mind when disclosing any personal data to us via the Internet.</p>
                   <p>You are solely responsible for the protection of your Device, including any use of Emoodi or any storage of Personal Information or data incident to the use of Emoodi on your Device.  Please consult your Device’s documentation on how to manage local storage and how to apply appropriate security controls to the Device for the protection of information such as passwords.  You are entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Device password.</p>
                   <p>Personal Information or data that is stored on your Device is your responsibility.  In the event that your Device becomes lost or inoperable, your data may not be recoverable.</p>
                   <h2>Privacy Policy Updates</h2>
                   <p>At times, it may be necessary for us to make changes to this Privacy Policy such as due to changes in the Services we offer, Apple’s policies and procedures, Google’s policies and procedures, and/or the applicable laws of Australia.  We reserve the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time without prior notice.  Please review this Privacy Policy periodically, especially before you provide and Personal Information or data to Emoodi.</p>
                   <p>Any changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective when we post the revised Privacy Policy on the Application.  As set forth above, your continued use of the Application after any changes or revisions to this Privacy Policy shall indicate your acceptance and agreement with the terms of revised Privacy Policy.</p>
                   <h2>International Users</h2>
                   <p>Emoodi is located in Australia and is subject to the applicable state/commonwealth laws of Australia.  If you use Emoodi, you consent to the use and disclosure of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and subject to such laws.</p>
